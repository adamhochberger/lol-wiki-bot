## Discord bot for pulling League of Legends information from FANDOM Wiki

### By Adam Hochberger

---

This bot is mainly for personal usage and will enable easy viewing of information from the official League of Legends wikipedia pages. This bot will use a simple `!lol [entry]` command to pull and message the information (to a channel or user, based on preference). Additionally functionality can come later, including team building or mock drafts. If this were to occur the bot would be renamed/separated for different functionalities.
